I am a Developer with a background in design and audio production and a BSBA in Marketing. I love working with HTML, CSS, PHP, Python and especially JavaScript frameworks such as Vue or React. I’m very interested in learning new and different Front-End Technologies such as Static Site Generators, Headless CMS, CSS Grid, or SVG Animation, and on occasion I write about what I’ve learned.

I'm currently working on improving my full-stack development skills with Python and the Django Framework.

I built this blog using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eleventy</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tailwind</a>. They're both fairly easy to use, highly customizable and a lot of fun, if you’re a nerd like me. You should definitely check them out.

From time to time, I post music on my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/soards).
