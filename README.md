# Blog.Soards.Me 👨🏻‍💻

This is my personal blog built with Eleventy and Tailwind - a pretty sweet combo IMHO.

It requires no webpack or any other build setup.

Instead it just uses a few npm scripts for eleventy and postcss.

Code syntax highlighting uses PrismJS - Material Oceanic.

It is deployed on Netlify.

Install dependencies:
`npm i`

To develop:
`npm start`

To build for prod:
`npm run build`
